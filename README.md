# VoiceBox – Emotions (anger Fear0/Intensity Filter Communication Aid

## What it is
A simple, local-only (no cloud) communication device/app for people who:
- Have high-intensity emotions, anger, frustration, or mental health issues.
- Want to say exactly what they mean without it coming out sounding violent, threatening, or "crazy."
- Get dismissed, escalated, or labeled because of tone/words when angry.
- Refuse to mute themselves or pretend to be calm when they’re not.

Similar to AAC (augmentative and alternative communication) devices used for non-verbal people, but this is for verbal adults/caregivers/Adults who need tone control, not speech generation.

## Core Features (planned)
- Input: Voice (mic) or typed text (raw, unfiltered — full of swearing/frustration if that’s how it comes out).
- Processing: Local filter detects high-emotion language (cursing, sarcasm, intensity markers) and replaces/rephrases with neutral, factual version while preserving meaning.
  - Example input: "This IEP is fucking bullshit and they’re lying about Walter’s needs."
  - Example output: "The IEP does not accurately reflect Walter’s documented needs."
- Output options: Text (for email/post), calm voice synthesis (text-to-speech in your natural voice, toned down), or both.
- Override button: “Keep raw” — send original if you want the edge (e.g., when you need to be heard loud and clear).
- Fully offline/local: No data leaves device. No subscription. No company owns your words.
- Privacy-first: No cloud upload, no analytics, no selling data.

## Why it exists
Built for caregivers of non-verbal/minimally verbal kids who deal with constant frustration (IEPs that lie, devices that brick, systems that gatekeep). Anger builds, tone gets weaponized against you, and suddenly you’re the “crazy” one instead of the person pointing out real problems. This tool lets the truth get through without handing people the “unstable” label.

Built for anyone adult that recogonizes they dont  have a affactive communication skillset. 

## Status
- Early concept / guinea-pig phase.
- Testing on myself first (real-time rants → filtered output).
- Open to feedback, collaborators, or forks — but no cloud bullshit.

## License
MIT (or whatever you choose) — free to use/modify, just don’t make it and not include me from the start.

## Contact / Contribute
Open issues or PRs. No formal team yet — solo project for now.

Built because I’m tired of being dismissed for how I sound when not calm and emotions involved .
everyone deserves to be heard and everyone deserves to not be scared/confused to listen
